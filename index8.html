						<h2>Photo Tips</h2>
						<p>Sometimes it's hard to act natural when a camera is pointed at you. You may be fine and laughing one moment but as soon as the camera is looking at you, you tense up. I know this happens -- because I'm the worst person when it comes to posing and smiling naturally in photos (it's probably because I'm always the one on the other side of the camera). You may become insecure and hyperaware of how you look, but try to let those worries ease and have confidence knowing every smile is beautiful. If this pep talk is not enough, check out some tips for posing and smiling that I've compiled. </p>
