						<h2>elena kathleen perez</h2>
						<p>I started out taking pictures because I wanted to capture memories; important places in time. As my photography has evolved to higher quality portrait work, my purpose hasn't changed. I still want to capture those important moments in time. Senior year is an important time as any other, and I'd like to capture that moment for you. My gear includes a Canon EOS 70D, 50mm prime lens, reflector board, and occasional tripod. Usually I'll have two people assisst me during photoshoots; Olivia and Brynn. Olivia is like a stylist, she'll tell you how to smile, where to look, and what clothes to wear. She's spent many years training for this job by looking through countless instagram posts and magazine photos. Brynn on the other hand has spent many years training in the gym to hold the reflector and working on her comedy genius. She masterfully maneuvers the reflector board to get that perfect glow and cracks jokes in time for me to snap a laughing candid. Together, we are a team that will capture you the way you want to remember yourself in 20 years.</p>
